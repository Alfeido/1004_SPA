The Project Ace0Ace is a single page application designed to teach users about cards and become familiar with them. It will also include a very basic and simple game to interact with.
The SPA is styled in a theme similar to cards themselves. The background colour will be a dark green similar to table typically used to play card games such as poker or black jack. Items alone the page will be of a red
black and white theme to mimic a standard playing card deck's colour palette. The project can accept data from how well the user does in the card game and can display it elsewhere. The data is stored in a json file using
JavaScript which is also used to make the game.

To play the game, open that page via the navbar, the button that specifies "Game" will reveal the page that contains the game, then click the play button. The cards will move around and you as the user need to
click on the one that contains the Ace. If you as the user would like the game scores to be recorded please upload a json file first so it can be written to. DIV pages can be implemented in a SPA by containing 
them in divs, then using a button and JavaScript to manipulate it when it is pressed it will change style properties to stop hiding the pages.
