        <div class="spades"><img src="images/Royal_Flush.png"><br>The king of all hands! It’s the unbeatable combo of A, K, Q, J, and 10 all in the same suit. If you land this, feel free to bask in your glory—nothing tops it.</div>
        <div class="hearts"><img src="images/Straight_Flush.png"><br>Almost as rare as its royal cousin, this is five consecutive cards of the same suit (like 6-7-8-9-10 of diamonds). It’s the silent assassin—smooth, deadly, and nearly unbeatable.</div>
        <div class="clubs"><img src="images/Four_of_a_Kind.png"><br>Talk about domination! Four cards of the same rank (like four Queens) show you mean business. Just one card away from a Full House, but way more intimidating.</div>  
        <div class="diamonds"><img src="images/Full_House.png"><br>A powerful mix of three of a kind and a pair (like three Kings and two 5s). It’s like having backup dancers that are just as good as the lead—balanced and beautiful.</div>
        <div class="spades"><img src="images/Flush.png"><br>Five cards of the same suit, all dressed to impress but without needing to be in order (like 2-5-8-J-K of hearts). It’s stylish, sophisticated, and surprisingly strong.</div>
        <div class="hearts"><img src="images/Straight.png"><br>Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (like 4-5-6-7-8). It’s all about order and progression—no need for matching outfits when you’ve got perfect choreography.</div>
        <div class="clubs"><img src="images/Three_of_a_Kind.png"><br>Three cards of the same rank (like three 9s). It’s solid and dependable, like a trusty sidekick that packs a punch.</div>
        <div class="diamonds"><img src="images/Two_Pair.png"><br>Double trouble! Two pairs of different ranks (like two Jacks and two 3s). It’s not flashy, but it’s crafty and can catch opponents off guard.</div>
        <div class="spades"><img src="images/Pair.png"><br>Just two cards of the same rank (like two 7s). It’s the bare minimum for feeling a little confident—like finding a $20 bill in an old coat pocket.</div>
        <div class="hearts"><img src="images/High_Card.png"><br>When all else fails, it’s your best single card that has to do the talking (like Ace high). Not exactly a power move, but sometimes bluffing is half the battle.</div>
