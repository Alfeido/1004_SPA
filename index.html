      <center><div class="grid-container">
          <div class="spades"><img src="images/Royal_Flush.png"><br><h2>Royal Flush<br>Number One</h2>The king of all hands! It’s the unbeatable combo of A, K, Q, J, and 10 all in the same suit. If you land this, feel free to bask in your glory—nothing tops it.</div>
          <div class="hearts"><img src="images/Straight_Flush.png"><br><h2>Straight Flush<br>Number Two</h2>Almost as rare as its royal cousin, this is five consecutive cards of the same suit (like 6-7-8-9-10 of diamonds). It’s the silent assassin—smooth, deadly, and nearly unbeatable.</div>
          <div class="clubs"><img src="images/Four_of_a_Kind.png"><br><h2>Four of a Kind<br>Number Three</h2>Talk about domination! Four cards of the same rank (like four Queens) show you mean business. Just one card away from a Full House, but way more intimidating.</div>  
          <div class="diamonds"><img src="images/Full_House.png"><br><h2>Full House<br>Number Four</h2>A powerful mix of three of a kind and a pair (like three Kings and two 5s). It’s like having backup dancers that are just as good as the lead—balanced and beautiful.</div>
          <div class="spades"><img src="images/Flush.png"><br><h2>Flush<br>Number Five</h2>Five cards of the same suit, all dressed to impress but without needing to be in order (like 2-5-8-J-K of hearts). It’s stylish, sophisticated, and surprisingly strong.</div>
          <div class="hearts"><img src="images/Straight.png"><br><h2>Straight<br>Number Six</h2>Five consecutive cards of mixed suits (like 4-5-6-7-8). It’s all about order and progression—no need for matching outfits when you’ve got perfect choreography.</div>
          <div class="clubs"><img src="images/Three_of_a_Kind.png"><br><h2>Three of a Kind<br>Number Seven</h2>Three cards of the same rank (like three 9s). It’s solid and dependable, like a trusty sidekick that packs a punch.</div>
          <div class="diamonds"><img src="images/Two_Pair.png"><br><h2>Two Pair<br>Number Eight</h2>Double trouble! Two pairs of different ranks (like two Jacks and two 3s). It’s not flashy, but it’s crafty and can catch opponents off guard.</div>
          <div class="spades"><img src="images/Pair.png"><br><h2>One Pair<br>Number Nine</h2>Just two cards of the same rank (like two 7s). It’s the bare minimum for feeling a little confident—like finding a $20 bill in an old coat pocket.</div>
          <div class="hearts"><img src="images/High_Card.png"><br><h2>High Card<br>Number Ten</h2>When all else fails, it’s your best single card that has to do the talking (like Ace high). Not exactly a power move, but sometimes bluffing is half the battle.</div>

        <div class="spades"><h2>Origins in Ancient China</h2>Playing cards are believed to have originated in China during the Tang dynasty, around the 9th century AD.</div>
        <div class="hearts"><h2>Evolution to 52 cards</h2>The standard deck of 52 cards wasn't always the norm. Historically, decks varied in size, containing 24, 36, 40, or 48 cards. The 52-card deck gained prominence, likely due to British and French colonial influence.</div>
        <div class="clubs"><h2>French Suit Symbols</h2>The suits we recognize today—hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades—were standardized by French card makers around 1480. This design choice simplified production and contributed to the widespread adoption of the French deck.</div>  
        <div class="diamonds"><h2>Symbolism of the Deck</h2>A standard deck's composition mirrors elements of the calendar: 52 cards represent the weeks in a year, four suits correspond to the seasons, and 13 cards per suit align with the lunar months.</div>
        <div class="spades"><h2>World War 2</h2>During World War II, special decks were created for American prisoners of war. When moistened, these cards revealed maps detailing escape routes from German camps.</div>
        <div class="hearts"><h2>Ace of Spades in Vietnam</h2>In the Vietnam War, U.S. soldiers used the Ace of Spades as a psychological tactic, believing it symbolized death and would intimidate Viet Cong soldiers.</div>
        <div class="clubs"><h2>Diverse Global Designs</h2>Different cultures have developed unique card designs. For instance, German-suited cards feature hearts, bells, acorns, and leaves as suits, differing from the French system.</div>
        <div class="diamonds"><h2>Largest Producer</h2>The United States Playing Card Company, established in 1867 in Cincinnati, Ohio, is the world's largest producer of playing cards, manufacturing over 100 million decks annually.</div>
        <div class="spades"><h2>Design Evolution</h2>The double-headed or reversible face cards were introduced in the 19th century to prevent players from having to turn the cards upright during games, enhancing gameplay efficiency.</div>
        <div class="hearts"><h2>Solitaire's Mathmatical Complexity</h2>Despite its simple appearance, the game of Solitaire presents significant mathematical challenges. Notably, mathematician Persi Diaconis highlighted the difficulty in analyzing its probabilities and outcomes.</div>
